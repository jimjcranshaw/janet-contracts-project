    "riskDetails": "Published Framework Value (Tender Notice): The advertised spend for legal services as specified in the procurement documents and this Tender Notice is indicative only. This value reflects the anticipated demand; however, actual expenditure may vary due to the unpredictable nature of legal requirements and the varied resource constraints of the HALA members. In the event that this known unknown risk materialises, the Contracting Authority reserves the right to undertake a permitted modification in accordance with Schedule 8(5)(a) of the Act.\nAdvertised Lot Values: The advertised lot values for this framework have been determined on the basis of current market conditions, anticipated framework utilisation, and the terms of the existing framework (terminating in 2026). The Contracting Authority recognises that future changes in market conditions may result in discrepancies between the estimated and actual values.\nHALA Membership: The anticipated growth in HALA membership during the life of the framework is difficult for the Contracting Authority to forecast. This could also have a material impact on the spend through the framework however.\nIn the event that this known unknown risk materialises, the Contracting Authority reserves the right to undertake a permitted modification in accordance with Schedule 8(5)(a) of the Act.\nTenderers' Pricing Submissions: Tenderers must submit prices to be fixed for the duration of the contract, subject to a potential permitted indexation adjustment, commencing on the second anniversary of the contract. Price adjustments will be permitted based on movements in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) as published by the Office for National Statistics (or any successor index). These potential adjustments are subject to a cap of 3% (as such, if the actual CPI increase surpasses 3%, the applied adjustment will still be limited to 3%).\nIt is acknowledged that the overall estimated framework spend published in this tender notice may be exceeded and that the permitted pricing adjustments may be a contributing factor in the final framework value exceeding the initially advertised amount.\nIn the event that the overall framework spend exceeds the advertised value, the Contracting Authority reserves the right to vary the framework agreement during its term in accordance with Schedule 8(5)(a) of the Act.",
